 The Simple 30 Workouts Training Plan | Built with ReactJS & FantaðŸ’ªCSS 

  I built a neat little 30-day workout app using React and Vite, spiced up with ESLint for some clean code! It's a straightforward program anyone can jump into, and the cool part is it remembers your progress locally. That means folks can easily track their journey, see how far they've come, and even revisit their favorite routines. Pretty handy for staying consistent! Hope you enjoy using it!

React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh
